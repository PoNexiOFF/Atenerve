# 🧙 » Atenerve

Atenerve is a discord bot with an integrated RPG. This one is very complete and promotes the meeting between the players. Atenerve is currently under development and is therefore not accessible to the public. You can still join our [support server](https://discord.gg/CrQ7UTN8am) to know the progress of the project.
